### I'm Kymberly! aka The Great Snazzwaggler
My professional title is **Jack of all Trades** 🃏
Though I've always liked theatre, I've never been a "theater kid." Though I've always played sports, I've never been the "athletic kid." I can't be defined by one thing because I love to explore many different interests! I'm an inventor, a storyteller, an experience designer, technical *and* artsy, and I’m ready to “sail away from the safe harbor” of my known world and “explore, dream, discover.” -Mark Twain
